# Sudoku Solver

CMP2020M CMP3755 Logic and Computation (Part of Assessment 1), Achieved 70% (For code and report)

Originally created 2023

Python code to solve a given sudoku problem using the Z3 Problem Solver
The code itself is largely taken and adapter from [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzQUe5QWad8), but the discussion from the report was 'very detailed' and was 'exemplary (ie could be given to future students to show how to do it) for this type of answer'
